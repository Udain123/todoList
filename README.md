# todoList
I Udain Srivastava have made the ToDoList website and uploaded all the files. I have not uploaded the node modules.
In order to run the site locally you can use the following commands in the command line:
1) mongod (to run the mongodb server locally)
2) mongo (to see the database and all the items)
3) nodemon app.js (to run the server )
There are various others command which can be used.
